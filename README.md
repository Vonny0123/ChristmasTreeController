# Christmas Tree Controller

This repository contains code to host a Flask web server for controlling an RGB Christmas Tree (https://thepihut.com/products/3d-rgb-xmas-tree-for-raspberry-pi). Currently the control is limited to the three example functions and controlling brightness.

To run the application, clone the repository and run the command:

`python3 /path/to/directory/ChristmasTreeController/main.py`

Then the interface will be available on port 5000.
